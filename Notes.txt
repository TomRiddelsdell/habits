Plan:
- all of the following front-end steps should be deployed to main and tested at each step (to avoid broken deployment we experienced previously)
- npm install the amplify modules and test usage of a standard component 
- setup login/auth
- create a collection in figma to represent a collection of habits
- create a page that diplays all of a users habits
- add a search element to filter the users habits

Notes:
- it seems the amplify UI designer is no longer available, so there's no need to 'amplify pull'. 
  All changes will need to be made directly in the code and we only ever need to push 

Issues:
- NPM and Amplify CLI do not get installed on container start-up
