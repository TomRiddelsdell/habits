# habits
This project aims to create an application for monitoring habits. We will:
- Provide desktop and andriod front-ends to record habits and monitor progress
- Leverage AWS cloud for storage and compute
- Back-end will be written in Java

As a Java and Cloud newbie this project is as much about exploration of the technologies as it is about the product. 
Any feedback on implementation is welcome!
