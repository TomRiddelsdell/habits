- Should we have the same event for habit creation and habit modification?
    - no
- What should the addHabit service look like (i.e. how do we translate the command into events to store)?
    - My first instinct is the hide the fact that I plan to use CQRS within the service implementation rather than having separate classes. Having said that, 
    it's not a large lift to separate into 2 classes and it may protect against extensions that mix them later.
    - Currently, after separation the query API will only have a fromId fn; which seems a little thin. Maybe this is just a natural step before 
    we start pulling out any meaningful analytics though.
- Should we have a specific HabitRepository or a generic EventStore?
    - A generic event store seems appropriate. 
    - We can have a single set of tests that specify the expected behaviour of our event store
    - An in memory fake can be used for the purpose of unit testing
- Allow for multiple users by adding a habit UUID and a user
    - This raises the question of "how far through the stack should the user be passed?". The options here are:
        a. Make all fns in both the command and query APIs take a Role object
        b. Validate the user within each service method and do not require one for operations on aggregates/event store
        c. Have a session context object from which we can extract the current user
    (a) seems like the most safe as if we ensure the event store requires a role to access any event, any badly written service methods will not be
    able to perform harmful operations. If we compare (a) with (b), (a) has the downside that the event repository must perform validation of the role. 
    In (b) the event store has no requirement for role validation but it sacrifices some security as a malicious connection could access all events. (c)
    seems like a middle groud between (a) and (b) which prevents an upfront decision about where to validate the user. The event store may or may not 
    enforce connections to provide a role and the service method implementations could be written accordingly. I don't like this as much as it reduces
    consistency. A good use case to consider is changing user validation rules or the addition of a new role. Ideally, such a change would only require
    modification in 1 place, rather than updating logic scattered throughout the code base. This could be achieved by permissioning each aggregate individually
    as either RW or RO. Each command/query could potentially have its own rules to determine execution permission. It makes sense to me to keep this validation
    in the application layer. At the DB level we would expect RO or RW per table/document which corresponds quite closely to RO/RW per aggregate. 
    --> There are 2 concepts I need to be careful about here. 1) the distinction between User and Role. We have a many to 1 mapping as the customer and 
    all admins are Users that should have permission to modify an aggregate, but there are only 2 roles HabitTrackingUser and Admin that can modify An
    aggregate. The User -> Role mapping is an application layer concern and not part of the core domain. The enforcement of access for a Role is domain 
    logic and should be handled there. This indicates that the domain methods called should verify the Role and the Identity & Access supporting domain
    should be responsible for verifying a User has a particular Role. 
    ---> To implement this we should have the application service call I&A to create a Role and that role should be an arg to any domain method. It does not 
    however need to be passed all the way down to the event store - expecting the event store to verify the role would actually be a leak of business
    logic into the infra layer.
- Should we separate Event into a separated interface?
    - The existing impl means that all repositories need to either natively communicate via Events or they need to adapt their internal representation 
    of an event to an Event in an embedded ACL
    - If we make Event an interface instead of a concrete implementation then repositories can use any implementation of Event that they see fit. 
    - In the case of our internal impl of a repo like EventStoreInMemory we are ok to use Events natively - so no benefit there. However, if we were 
    to adopt a 3rd party event store then that store would have it's own representation of an event. If we use a concrete class then the fields would
    have to be copied from the 3rd party rep to the Event. If we use an interface then we could simply create a lightweight wrapper for the 3rd party
    event class which maps the fields, preventing any copying providing the format is suitable.
